### Enjoy modern dev stack
Build websites using latest web tech tools that developers love - Vue.js, GraphQL and Webpack. Get hot-reloading and all the power of Node.js. Gridsome makes building websites fun again.

### Bring your own data
Gridsome lets you use any CMS or data source for content. Pull data from WordPress, Contentful or any other headless CMS or APIs and access it with GraphQL in your components and pages.

### Mobile-first architecture
Only critical HTML, CSS and JavaScript are loaded at first, and then the next pages are prefetched in the background so users can click around extremely fast without page reloads and even offline

### Extremely fast loading
Gridsome automatically optimises your frontend to load and perform blazing fast. You get code-splitting, asset optimisation, lazy-loading, and almost perfect Lighthouse scores out-of-the-box.

### Scale globally at no cost
Gridsome sites can be entirely hosted on a CDN and can handle thousands to millions of hits without breaking - and no expensive server costs. 

### The frontend for the headless
Design and build websites that are decoupled from the CMS. This means you can easily change the CMS later or test a complete redesign without breaking your site.

## Get started

```sh
$ npm install -g @gridsome/cli
$ gridsome create awesome-site
$ cd awesome-site
$ gridsome develop
```

Your browser will now open your site at `http://localhost:8080`. Happy coding!
